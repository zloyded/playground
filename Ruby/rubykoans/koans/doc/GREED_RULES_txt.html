<p>Greed is a dice game played among 2 or more players, using 5 six-sided
dice.</p>

<h2 id="label-Playing+Greed">Playing Greed<span><a href="#label-Playing+Greed">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Each player takes a turn consisting of one or more rolls of the dice. On
the first roll of the game, a player rolls all five dice which are scored
according to the following:</p>

<pre>Three 1&#39;s =&gt; 1000 points
Three 6&#39;s =&gt;  600 points
Three 5&#39;s =&gt;  500 points
Three 4&#39;s =&gt;  400 points
Three 3&#39;s =&gt;  300 points
Three 2&#39;s =&gt;  200 points
One   1   =&gt;  100 points
One   5   =&gt;   50 points</pre>

<p>A single die can only be counted once in each roll.  For example, a “5” can
only count as part of a triplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as a
single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.</p>

<p>Example Scoring</p>

<pre>Throw       Score
---------   ------------------
5 1 3 4 1   50 + 2 * 100 = 250
1 1 1 3 1   1000 + 100 = 1100
2 4 4 5 4   400 + 50 = 450</pre>

<p>The dice not contributing to the score are called the non-scoring dice. 
“3” and “4” are non-scoring dice in the first example.  “3” is a
non-scoring die in the second, and “2” is a non-score die in the final
example.</p>

<p>After a player rolls and the score is calculated, the scoring dice are
removed and the player has the option of rolling again using only the
non-scoring dice. If all of the thrown dice are scoring, then the player
may roll all 5 dice in the next roll.</p>

<p>The player may continue to roll as long as each roll scores points. If a
roll has zero points, then the player loses not only their turn, but also
accumulated score for that turn. If a player decides to stop rolling before
rolling a zero-point roll, then the accumulated points for the turn is
added to his total score.</p>

<p>Before a player is allowed to accumulate points, they must get at least 300
points in a single turn. Once they have achieved 300 points in a single
turn, the points earned in that turn and each following turn will be
counted toward their total score.</p>

<h2 id="label-End+Game">End Game<span><a href="#label-End+Game">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h2>

<p>Once a player reaches 3000 (or more) points, the game enters the final
round where each of the other players gets one more turn. The winner is the
player with the highest score after the final round.</p>

<p>Greed is described on Wikipedia at <a

however the rules are a bit different from the rules given here.</p>
